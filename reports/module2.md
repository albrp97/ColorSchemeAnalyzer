**Generated ID:** NORD_MOD2_V8

## 1. Filter Stack (Top Left)
* **ID:04 (FILTER STACK):** Shows the palette under various constraints (Brightness 65%, 10%, Saturation 50%, Luminance 50%).

## 2. Main Stack (Bottom Left)
* **ID:05 (RAW PALETTE):** The palette in its original definition order.
* **ID:06 (LUMA SORT):** Sorted by luminance.
* **ID:07 (HUE RAMP):** Smooth gradient sorted by hue.
* **ID:08 (LUMA RAMP):** Smooth gradient sorted by luminance.

## 3. Distribution & Matching (Right)
* **ID:09 (INDEXED: 4x4):** 4x4 grid of the palette.
* **ID:10 (CLOSE MATCHES: 10%):** Pairs of colors with less than 10% luminance difference.
* **ID:11 (CLOSE MATCHES: 30%):** Pairs of colors with less than 30% luminance difference.
