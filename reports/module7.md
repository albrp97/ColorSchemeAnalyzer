# Module 7: Complementary Desaturation Planes
**Generated ID:** NORD_MOD7_COMP

This module visualizes how the palette handles transitions between opposing colors.

### The Visualization Logic
Each box represents a 2D slice of color space:
* **X-Axis (Hue/Saturation):** The left edge is Color A. The right edge is Color B (its opposite). The center is Neutral Gray.
* **Y-Axis (Brightness):** Top is White. Bottom is Black.

### Analysis
* **ID:30 (RED/CYAN):** Transition between Red and Cyan.
* **ID:31 (ORANGE/AZURE):** Transition between Orange and Azure.
* **ID:32 (YELLOW/BLUE):** Transition between Yellow and Blue.
* **ID:33 (CHARTREUSE/VIOLET):** Transition between Chartreuse and Violet.
* **ID:34 (GREEN/MAGENTA):** Transition between Green and Magenta.
* **ID:35 (SPRING-GREEN/ROSE):** Transition between Spring-Green and Rose.
